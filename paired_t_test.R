# A paired-samples t-test was used to determine whether there was a 
# statistically significant mean difference between the distance ran 
# when participants imbibed a carbohydrate-protein drink compared to 
# a carbohydrate-only drink. No outliers were ditected. The assumption
# of normality was not violated, as assesed by Shipro-Wilk's test 
# (p = 0.780). Participants ran further when imbibing the carbohydrate-
# protein drink (Mean = 11.302 KM, SD = 0.713 KM) as opposed to the
# carbohydrate only drink (Mean =  11.167 KM, SD = 0.726 KM), a 
# statistically significant mean increase of 0.135 KM, 
# 95% CI [0.091, 0.181], t(19) = 6.352, p < = .001, Cohen's d estimate: 0.187.
